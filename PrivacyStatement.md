# What data do we collect?
 - We use Google Analytics. In the process of using Google Analytics, we will only be counting pageView. For more information on that, see https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061.
 - We don't record your IP address. However, Google Analytics would use your IP to estimate a rough ballpark of where you are in the world. This also happens every time you open Google.
 - We would collect data on loading time in each app stage, a calculated value to measure performance, BPM you are using, along with your user agent. In this process, we would generate a random session ID for your particular session.
 - If you report your user experience, we would associate your experience with the data we collected in the previous step using the unique session ID of your session.
 - If you don't turn off the data gathering toggle on the loading page, we would collect the data of your interaction with the model - your input and its output. This would be associated with your session ID.

# How do we use these data?
 - We don't collect personal data. All datas cannot be traced back to you.
 - We will not use the data we gather for commerical purposes.

 - We may use the data to improve application performance and user experience.
 - We may use the data for academic research.

# How do you delete your data?
 - We provide a kill switch within Settings for you to delete all your data from our server. Once you click it, the server data would be deleted and you would automatically exit the application.
 - Once you leave your session, we cannot delete your data, because we have no way of knowing which data is yours.
